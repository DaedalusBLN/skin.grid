## About
This is a fork of the Grid Kodi skin by Jeroen, modified to be compatible with Kodi 18 Leia. I was sad to hear Jeroen had stopped development on the skin, and I have therefore fixed the bugs I have found, when running it on Kodi 18. Furthermore, I have made some modifications to try experiment a bit, and learn about Kodi skinning. 

Grid is a graphical user interface for Kodi. The goal for Grid is to provide an elegant and intuitive way of enjoying all the wonderful features that Kodi provides. The design and development focuses on feature quality rather than quantity with a lot of attention spent on the little details that matter.
